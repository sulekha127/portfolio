                For this project, I developed a user-friendly web application 
                that streamlined university management tasks such as student 
                registration, course management, and grade tracking. Using 
                HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL, I created an intuitive 
                interface that allowed for easy data input and retrieval.

                In this project, I developed a Twitter data 
                analytics project that allowed for the extraction 
                and analysis of insights from Twitter data. By utilizing 
                various Python libraries and tools, I was able to analyze 
                tweets and identify trends and sentiments. This project 
                demonstrated my ability to work with big data and extract
